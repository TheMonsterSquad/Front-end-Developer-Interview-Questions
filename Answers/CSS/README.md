# CSS Questions

* :confused: What is the difference between classes and ID's in CSS?

* :confused: What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?

> Reset: It sets default values for basic elements and reduces browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, etc.

> Normalize: TBD

* :sunglasses: Describe Floats and how they work.

>  Float is a CSS positioning property. Elements are floated horizontally, this means that an element can only be floated left or right, not up or down.

> A floated element will move as far to the left or right as it can. Usually this means all the way to the left or right of the containing element. The elements after the floating element will flow around it. The elements before the floating element will not be affected.

> *Note: Elements after the floating element will flow around it. To avoid this, use the clear property. The clear property specifies which sides of an element other floating elements are not allowed.*

* :confused: Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.

* :confused: Describe BFC(Block Formatting Context) and how it works.

* :sunglasses: What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?

> add a empty element `clear: both/left/right`: semantically too verbose
`overflow: hidden`: good one, but something, overflow is been used.
clearfix use :after psudo-class: require CSS3 support


> 1 - **Floating the container**

> If you float an element containing floats, it will encompass its content. The side-effect of this is that we add another floated element to the page, while we most of the times want it to behave as a regular block element. That is solved by applying a width of 100% to the container as well, so it forces a line-break before the content after it.

> **Downsides**
* Setting a width to 100% might collide with desired padding.
* IE 6 seems to add an extra bottom margin in some cases.


> 2 -  **Adding `overflow: hidden;` To the container**

> If you add `overflow: hidden;` to the containing element, it will automatically adjust its height and take the floated children into account.

> 3 - **Generating Content Through CSS (recommended)**

> Another alternative is to use the CSS pseudo-class `:after` to generate content after the containing element, using it to clear floats and then hiding itself. Personally, I donâ€™t like this approach since it generates content to the page that has nothing to do there in the first place.
```css
.container-with-generated-content:after {
  content: ".";
  display: block;
  height: 0;
  clear: both;
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

> **Downsides**

> Not IE 6 nor IE 7 supports the `:after` pseudo-class, so you need to apply a hasLayout fix for both of them. Note that IE 7 also supports a hasLayout fix.

* :sunglasses: Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.

> CSS Sprites is a method of combining multiple images used throughout your website into one large image (or "sprite") to reduce the total number network requests for images. Using this sprite image with the proper `background-position` CSS attributes and X, Y coordinates, it is then possible to display a particular image.

> **2014: H5BP Image Replacement 2**

> This doesn't really replace a single element with an image, it just does a good job at hiding an element from view while remaining accessible to screen readers. So you could use whatever you wanted to display the image, then put text next to it.
```html
<h1 class="visuallyhidden">
  H5BP
</h1>
```
```css
h1.visuallyhidden {
  border: 0;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  height: 1px;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 0;
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
}
```

> Hide only visually, but have it available for screen readers:

> **2012: Scott Kellum Method**

> Positions text outside the container and hides with overflow.
>```html
<h1>
  Scott Kellum Method
</h1>
```
```css
h3.skm {
  width: 300px;
  height: 75px;
  background: url(path/to/image);
  text-indent: 100%;
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

* :sunglasses: How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?

> 1 - Browser specific CSS hacks
```css
_color: blue /* ie6 */
*color: blue /* ie6, ie7 */
color: blue\9 /* ie6, ie7, ie8 */
```
 > 2 - Conditional stylesheets
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="css/style.css" />
<!--[if IE 7]><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="css/ie7.css"  />< ![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 6]><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="css/ie6.css"  />< ![endif]-->
```
3 - Conditional comments to set classes on the html element
```html
<!--[if lt IE 7]>      <html class="ie6"> <![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 7]>         <html class="ie7"> <![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 8]>         <html class="ie8"> <![endif]-->
<!--[if gt IE 8]><!--> <html>         <!--<![endif]-->
```
```css
div.foo { color: inherit;}
.ie6 div.foo { color: #ff8000; }
```

* :sunglasses: How do you serve your pages for feature-constrained browsers?
  * :sunglasses: What techniques/processes do you use?

> **Graceful Degredation** is an older, fault tolerant approach of disabling features based entirely on which browser is detected.

> **Progressive Enhancement** is able to support evergreen browsers by detecting support for specific features for HTML, CSS & JavaScript. Modernizr can be used to detect many HTML5 API's and CSS3 rules. If backwards compatibility is necessary, features may be supported using polyfills such as those provided by Autoprefixer or Babel.

* :sunglasses: What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?

>1. `position: absolute;  margin-left: -10000px;`
1. `display: none;`
1. `opacity: 0.0;`
1. `visibility: hidden;` # without changing the layout

* :confused: Have you ever used a grid system, and if so, what do you prefer?

* :confused: Have you used or implemented media queries or mobile specific layouts/CSS?

* :confused: Are you familiar with styling SVG?

* :confused: How do you optimize your webpages for print?

> In the case of a print stylesheet when the page is printed this functionality is enabled in CSS2 by media types. Media Types let you specify a type of media to target, so you could target print.

> Steps:
1. Create a stylesheet for print
1. Avoid unnecessary HTML tables
1. Know which portions of the page don't have any print value and use `.no-print { display: none; }`
1. Use page breaks
1. Size size your page for print
1. Test!

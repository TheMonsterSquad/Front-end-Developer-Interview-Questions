# CSS Questions

* :confused: What is the difference between classes and ID's in CSS?

* :confused: What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?

> Reset: It sets default values for basic elements and reduces browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, etc.

> Normalize: TBD

* :sunglasses: Describe Floats and how they work.

>  Float is a CSS positioning property. Elements are floated horizontally, this means that an element can only be floated left or right, not up or down.

> A floated element will move as far to the left or right as it can. Usually this means all the way to the left or right of the containing element. The elements after the floating element will flow around it. The elements before the floating element will not be affected.

> *Note: Elements after the floating element will flow around it. To avoid this, use the clear property. The clear property specifies which sides of an element other floating elements are not allowed.*

* :confused: Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.

* :confused: Describe BFC(Block Formatting Context) and how it works.

* :sunglasses: What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?

> add a empty element `clear: both/left/right`: semantically too verbose
`overflow: hidden`: good one, but something, overflow is been used.
clearfix use :after psudo-class: require CSS3 support


> 1 - **Floating the container**

> If you float an element containing floats, it will encompass its content. The side-effect of this is that we add another floated element to the page, while we most of the times want it to behave as a regular block element. That is solved by applying a width of 100% to the container as well, so it forces a line-break before the content after it.

> **Downsides**
* Setting a width to 100% might collide with desired padding.
* IE 6 seems to add an extra bottom margin in some cases.


> 2 -  **Adding `overflow: hidden;` To the container**

> If you add `overflow: hidden;` to the containing element, it will automatically adjust its height and take the floated children into account.

> 3 - **Generating Content Through CSS (recommended)**

> Another alternative is to use the CSS pseudo-class `:after` to generate content after the containing element, using it to clear floats and then hiding itself. Personally, I donâ€™t like this approach since it generates content to the page that has nothing to do there in the first place.
```
.container-with-generated-content:after {
  content: ".";
  display: block;
  height: 0;
  clear: both;
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

> **Downsides**

> Not IE 6 nor IE 7 supports the `:after` pseudo-class, so you need to apply a hasLayout fix for both of them. Note that IE 7 also supports a hasLayout fix.

* :sunglasses: Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.

> Concatenating small images into single large image to reduce request number. Using css background to show the right portion.

* :sunglasses: What are your favourite image replacement techniques and which do you use when?

> use `text-index: 100%;`

* :sunglasses: How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?

> IE specific CSS hacks
```
_color: blue /* ie6 */
*color: blue /* ie6, ie7 */
color: blue\9 /* ie6, ie7, ie8 */
```
Conditional Stylesheets
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="css/style.css" />
<!--[if IE 7]><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="css/ie7.css"  />< ![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 6]><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="css/ie6.css"  />< ![endif]-->
```
better solution than Conditional Stylesheets
```
<!--[if lt IE 7]>      <html class="ie6"> <![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 7]>         <html class="ie7"> <![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 8]>         <html class="ie8"> <![endif]-->
<!--[if gt IE 8]><!--> <html>         <!--<![endif]-->
div.foo { color: inherit;}
.ie6 div.foo { color: #ff8000; }
```

* :confused: How do you serve your pages for feature-constrained browsers?

1. `visibility: hidden;` # without changing the layout

# Contributing Guidelines

## Steps to answering a question

1.  Find questions that haven't been answered by searching for 😕 and then
search [open pull requests](../../../pulls) to ensure someone hasn't already answered.
If someone has, maybe you can contribute in the comments.

2.  Conduct research to ensure your answer follows current best practices
and collect citations from reputable sources such as:

    *   [W3C](http://www.w3.org/)
    *   [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/)
    *   [Quirks Mode](http://www.quirksmode.org/)
    *   [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    *   [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
    *   [HTML Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/)
    *   [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/)
    *   [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/coding/)

3.  Place your answer beneath the questions. Use code blocks where appropriate
and always cite sources as contextually as possible.

4.  Replace 😕face next to the question with a 😎 face.

5.  Open a pull request.

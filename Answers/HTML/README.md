# HTML Questions

* :sunglasses: What's a `doctype` do?

> The DOCTYPE describes the HTML that will be used in your page. Browsers also use the DOCTYPE to determine how to render a page. Not including a DOCTYPE or including an incorrect DOCTYPE can trigger quirks mode.

* :sunglasses: What's the difference between standards mode and quirks mode?

> There are now three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers: quirks mode, almost standards mode, and full standards mode. In **quirks mode**, layout emulates nonstandard behavior in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5 for Windows that is required not to break existing content on the Web. In **full standards mode**, the behavior is (hopefully) the behavior described by the HTML and CSS specifications. In **almost standards mode**, there are only a very small number of quirks implemented.

* :confused: What's the difference between HTML and XHTML?

* :sunglasses: Are there any problems with serving pages as `application/xhtml+xml`?

> Browsers will display xml parse errors if your page contains invalid code.

> Serving your pages as `application/xhtml+xml` will cause Internet Explorer 8 to show a download dialog box for an unknown format instead of displaying your page, as the first version of Internet Explorer with support for XHTML is Internet Explorer 9.

* :sunglasses: How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?

> To support multi language, include the tag `<meta charset="utf-8">` inside the document `<head>` tag.

> [W3](http://www.w3.org/International/O-charset)
/ [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4696499/meta-charset-utf-8-vs-meta-http-equiv-content-type)

> To indicate what language is used inside a tag, use the `lang` attribute.
> Supported on all elements but:
* `<applet>`
* `<base>`
* `<basefont>`
* `<br>`
* `<frame>`
* `<frameset>`
* `<iframe>`
* `<param>`
* `<script>`

> [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang)

* :sunglasses: What kind of things must you be wary of when design or developing for multilingual sites?

> 1. Character encoding
1. Language direction
1. Using the right language code
1. Font sizes

* :sunglasses: What are data- attributes good for?

> The specification for custom data attributes states that any attribute that starts with `data-` will be treated as a storage area for private data (private in the sense that the end user can’t see it – it doesn’t affect layout or presentation).

> This allows you to write valid HTML markup (passing an HTML 5 validator) while, simultaneously, embedding data within your page.

> This data can be easily accessed by JavaScript using `dataset`.

> [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes)

* :sunglasses: Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?

> The main building blocks are:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* SVG
<!-- TODO: Add image & media formats -->

> Where HTML is a language to define the mark-up of a document (titles, headers, body, footer, tables, input forms etc.),

> CSS is a language to define style (formatting, colors, shades etc).

> Javascript is a programming/scripting language.

> SVG is a language for creating 2D scalable vector graphics and images.

* :sunglasses: Describe the difference between cookies, sessionStorage and localStorage.

> They are all storage on the client side.

> Browsers that implement the “Web Storage” draft specification define two properties on the Window object: `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.

> Both properties refer to a Storage object—a persistent associative array that maps string keys to string values. Storage objects work much like regular JavaScript objects: simply set a property of the object to a string, and the browser will store that string for you. The difference between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` has to do with lifetime and scope: how long the data is saved for and who the data is accessible to.

> **Session Storage** is non persistent and scoped only to the current window.

> **Local Storage** is persistent and scoped to the domain.

> **Cookies** stores name/value pairs per domain with an expire time.

<!-- TODO: add IndexedDB API -->

* :confused: Describe the difference between `<script>`, `<script async>` and `<script defer>`.

* :confused: Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s between `<head></head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?

* :confused: What is progressive rendering?

* :confused: Have you used different HTML templating languages before?
